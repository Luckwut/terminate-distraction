# Terminate Distraction

A Chrome/Chromium extension that lets you block sites or hide unwanted elements on specific pages.  
You can create **rules** that match URLs with patterns (supports wildcards) and define behaviors like blocking entire pages or hiding selected elements using CSS selectors.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is still unfinished. Features may break or change at any time.

You can still try it out by grabbing the latest release and loading it as an **unpacked extension** in Chrome/Chromium:  
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`  
2. Enable **Developer mode**  
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the project folder  

Currently only supported on Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers.
